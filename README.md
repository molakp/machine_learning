# Machine Learning


This repository Project for the Machine Learning class 2021/2022 contains a collection of machine learning projects and examples implemented using Python and various machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. The projects cover a range of topics, including regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks.

## Projects
The following projects are included in this repository:

Linear Regression: A simple example of linear regression using scikit-learn.
Logistic Regression: An example of logistic regression using scikit-learn.
K-Means Clustering: An example of unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering.
Neural Network: An example of a simple neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.
Each project includes a README file with instructions on how to run the code and a brief explanation of the problem and the solution.
